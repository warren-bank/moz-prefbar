      <h2 id="v6.0.1">Changelog 6.0.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented whitelist for websites, allowed to import buttons. This whitelist is editable in the PrefBar configuration dialog and is presetted with one allowed websites, which is the PrefBar project page (prefbar.tuxfamily.org). (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 24212 "PREFBAR.JSON doesn't store Unicode data" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v6.0">Changelog 6.0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed button datasource format from RDF to JSON. PrefBar now saves button configuration to a file "prefbar.json" in your profile. Exported buttons are also JSON files, now. Older PrefBar versions won't be able to read buttons, exported from PrefBar 6.0! This change was required as the Firefox developers are also reducing their usage of RDF. This means, that there is a good chance, that we will have bugs in RDF, in future, which won't be fixed with priority (Manuel Reimer).</li>
        <li>prefbar:// URLs now support SHA1 and SHA256 checksums to be integrated into the URL. I'll use this in future to make import from the "More buttons" page even more secure. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>New value for resetting a pref from a menulist is now "!RESET!" (was: "PREFBARDEFAULT"). (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>"Slimbuttons" now is the default behaviour (makes buttons on PrefBar take less space). If you had disabled the feature, it is activated after this update and you have to disable it manually if you have any issues with it. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Got rid of some warnings in error console about octal literals and octal escape sequences being deprecated. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Added "Get more buttons" link to preferences window (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 23378 "Doubleclick on scrollbar in PrefBar edit window triggers "edit button"" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 23398 "PrefBar adds unneccessary "browserbtnupdatefor="false"" to extchecks/extlists in btn files" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 23399 ""ID" field should be pre-focused in "New Item" dialog" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 23418 "Importing btn file without accepting to overwrite buttons causes PrefBar toolbar to not be re-rendered" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 23711 "Can't add a new item if there are no Enabled Items" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 24065 ""PrefBar Toolbar" Appears Twice in [View &gt; Show/Hide] (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 24096 "Not available for SeaMonkey 2.1" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v5.1.1">Changelog 5.1.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22825 "IcedTea plugin for Java not detected" (Michael Buckley)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22918 "Chevron shown even when space on toolbar is sufficient" (dickvl)</li>
        <li>Moved all skin related stuff to a dedicated "skin" area and added new icon files for the different button icon sizes. This fixes some smaller bugs with Firefox nightlies (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Bumped minimal required Firefox version to 3.5, as my upgrade to the new drag&amp;drop API makes PrefBar incompatible with older releases (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Small fix to make "About PrefBar" window work in latest Firefox nightlies (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Modified PrefBar's XPCOM component according to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPCOM/XPCOM_changes_in_Gecko_2.0">latest changes in XPCOM</a> (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Added file format check to button import (Manuel Reimer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v5.1">Changelog 5.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22582 "Prefbar shows Java as activated while it is not" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22482 "Cannot Overwrite Button with New Version" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22394 "Execute buttons do not work correctly" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22088 ""clearall" not really clearing everything at all" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22383 "Regression in Prefbar 5.0.1: code in userChrome.css with negative margin values to make the toolbar as slim as possible no longer calculate the toolbar width correctly and leave white space at the right" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed some smaller bugs in drag&drop code of customize pane, which possibly could have caused a drag&drop operation to fail (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed bug, which slowed down the customize process of PrefBar by triggering resize events, while moving buttons (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Added small fix to make PrefBar work in Firefox 3.0.x, again. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Documented new way to move buttons to other toolbars in "Using Preferences Toolbar" section of this help system (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Optimized speed of all RDF operations (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Added "Copy button" feature. Just right click on a button entry in the customize pane and choose "Copy" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Added hack to work around a bug in SeaMonkey 2.0.x, which caused PrefBar to be cut off at the right end, on Windows systems (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>PrefBar now places its stuff to its own namespace and not longer pollutes global namespace (required to be accepted on addons.mozilla.org) (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>PrefBar menu moved from menubar to toolbar palette. This allowes you to move the menu as button to any place, you like, on any toolbar. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Now it's possible to disable the "prefbar://" pseudo URL, if you don't want this for security reasons, in the "Options" preferences pane. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v5.0.2">Changelog 5.0.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22409 "Preferences is nearly illegible on OS X 10.5." (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22408 "No Java Plugin found after upgrade to 5.0.1" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Made checkboxes a bit smaller in "slim buttons" mode (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Renamed context menu entry, for customizing PrefBar, to "Customize PrefBar..." so noone confuses this entry with the common "Customize..." entry of other toolbars (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Made PrefBar menu label localizable and added an accesskey to it (Manuel Reimer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v5.0.1">Changelog 5.0.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22344 "PrefBar Extends Toolbars Beyond Right Edge of Browser Window" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v5.0">Changelog 5.0</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Dropped SeaMonkey 1.x support and dropped many lines of old code, only needed to keep compatible with SM 1.x. PrefBar needs at least SeaMonkey 2.0, now. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Separated PrefBar in a "customizable toolbar" and a "toolbaritem" placed on the browser's "toolbarpalette". This change allowes the PrefBar buttons to be moved to other SeaMonkey/Firefox toolbars (as group, just like the bookmark toolbar items) and to move foreign buttons onto the PrefBar toolbar, using the Browser-built-in toolbar customize feature (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Dropped PrefBar's own OSD message handling and replaced with support for the browser notification bar (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Dropped old "toggle Flash" code. From now on, only the Plugin manager, built into the browser, is used for the Flash checkbox. If you port from SM 1.x to 2.x and had disabled Flash, then search your system for a file with the suffix ".prefbar" and drop this suffix or just reinstall Flash, so the browser finds it, again. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Made configuration window for Firefox look more "Firefox like" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Dropped two link buttons (xulplanet and mozillanews) and added one new link button to link to the PrefBar homepage (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Renamed some locale files to match the filename of the corresponding xul file (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Made PrefBar help system validate as XHTML 1.0 Strict (Manuel Reimer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v4.3.2">Changelog 4.3.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22163 "Java checkbox gets fooled by "Java Deployment Toolkit"" (Manuel Reimer):</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v4.3.1">Changelog 4.3.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22012 "Java plugin not detected in SM2 for OS/2" (Manuel Reimer):</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 22087 "clearurlbar not working any more" (Manuel Reimer):</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 18655 "Prefbar slows some browser actions down considerably" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 16048 "Add support for update URL" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v4.3">Changelog 4.3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cleaned up configuration dialog (Manuel Reimer):
          <ul>
            <li>Buttons between lists dropped</li>
            <li>Context menu added</li>
            <li>Items can be edited via doubleclick</li>
            <li>Items may be moved between/in lists via drag&amp;drop</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added several smaller fixes for SeaMonkey 2.0 (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Separated the plugin toggle stuff to two simple functions, as newer Firefox releases will require me to also use this code to toggle Java (Manuel Reimer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v4.2">Changelog 4.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Added possibility to add SOCKS proxies to Proxylist. More info <a href="use.html#editproxylist">here</a>(Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 20872 "Prefbar 4.1.1 messes up minimum window width" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Dropped all references to "window" object from PrefBar's global stuff and created Component to do the load, so "hiddenDOMWindow" hack is not longer needed on most platforms (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Experimental Firefox 3.5 support (hope this didn't break something else...) (Manuel Reimer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v4.1.2">Changelog 4.1.2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed Bug 19455 "Cookies: on or off?" (Manuel Reimer)</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Security: Enabled XPCNativeWrappers for SeaMonkey 1.x (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>The Flash checkbox now uses the builtin plugin manager, if running on SeaMonkey 2.x or Firefox 3.x, to toggle flash without the need to rename the plugin. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Now the "onClick" handler of buttons also gets called for middle clicks on buttons, to have another way to create "multifunctional" buttons. Have a look at "event.button", to find out which button has been used (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 19143 "PrefBar fails to initialize if SeaMonkey quickstart mode is used" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Fixed Bug 19142 "PrefBar update notifier doesn't stop on failed connections" (Manuel Reimer)</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Hotkey editor boxes now become red, if the hotkey is already taken by the browser or any other extension. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Now the "Del" key works in the customize window to delete the selected button(s) (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>If you moved PrefBar to anywhere else than its own toolbar and you open a popup window, where this target is hidden, then PrefBar will fall back to "own toolbar" for this popup window to be visible, again (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Improved error handling for code in buttons. One button with an bug in its code now not longer kills all buttons. Also improved error display in javascript console, which now displays more useful error messages for PrefBar button code (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>As the improved error handling now displays proper line numbers in the javascript console, I've added a "jump to line" feature to the context menu of any button code editor (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Added update notifier. If the next version of PrefBar gets available, PrefBar will tell you. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li>Added code, which moves the checkbox to enable/disable PrefBar in Firefox, to the submenu "View -> Toolbars". This was the last "Known Issue" on "addonsmirror.net" (Manuel Reimer)</li>

        <li> Added possiblity, to create submenus and to sort items into them, using drag&amp;drop or up/down buttons (Manuel Reimer) </li>
        <li> Added "prefbar://" URL handler, to allow to initiate a button download and import, by just one click to a website (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li> Added new function type "init-function" for buttons, extchecks and extlists. This may be used for buttons, which need code for initializing the button in some way. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li> Made "edit button" window larger and enabled "size saving", so the window keeps size between edit sessions. (Manuel Reimer)</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 id="v3.4.1">Changelog 3.4.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Fixed bug with the new code, which creates the initial database file in 3.4.x. Now you should not longer get a "Button database needs update" message after installing PrefBar to a fresh profile (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li> Fixed Bug 17117 "If hotkey is disabled, then arrow keys hide the prefbar" (Manuel Reimer)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v3.4">Changelog 3.4</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Updated button database format, to make it easier, to add some of the features, I'm planning for 3.5, 3.6 or even 4.0 (PrefBar will tell you that your database will be updated on startup). (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li> Fixed many smaller issues in toolbar rendering code. (Manuel Reimer)</li>
        <li> Updated Flash checkbox, again. Now the checkbox should work in OS/2, too, should be able to enable Flash, even if it has been disabled in the last session and will disable it, even if there are flash movies running (Manuel Reimer)</li>

        <li>Flash killing!  There is now a button to kill all flash embeds in the current page.</li>
        <li>New buttons.

See the <a href="buttons.html">button list</a> for more information</li>
        <li>Localization Support.  All the text strings have been moved to .dtd files in order to make the prefbar localizable.  I have already had three people volunteer to do the translations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="v2.1">Changelog 2.1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Enabled rebuilding of missing config files, allowing the prefbar to be used easier with multiple profiles.</li>
        <li>Fixed the bug that was preventing the PrefBar from working on 1.2a.</li>

        <li>Fixed a dozen or so small bugs pointed out to me by users.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="newbuttons">New Toolbar Buttons</h2>
      <p>
There are a whole bunch of new toolbar buttons in the prefbar2 that weren't avaiable in previous versions.  This includes the new user agent menulist, navigation buttons, developer buttons, and several new pref checks.  See the <a href="buttons.html">Button List</a> for more information.
      </p>

      <h2 id="customization">Customizable Toolbar</h2>
      <p>
        The toolbar is now completely customizable, with not only the ability to show only the buttons that you want, but the ability to display the buttons in any order you want, and even edit existing buttons or add new ones.  Click the customize button on your toolbar to access the PrefBar customization panel, or find it in the "Advanced" catagory of the main preferences window.
      </p>

      <h2 id="shortcutkey">Shortcut Key</h2>
      <p>You can now quickly show or hide the Preferences Toolbar whenever you need to by pressing the F8 key.  I was told that mac users would flame me for stealing one of their F keys, so I hope that doesn't happen.
      </p>

      <h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
      <p>I actually took the time to write a full featured documentation set for the PrefBar this time around (part of which you are currently viewing.)  This should make it a lot easier to use the PrefBar than previous versions, in which users pretty much had to figure everything out on their own.
      </p>

      <h2 id="license">License</h2>
      <p>
        The original Preferences Toolbar was licensed under the "assume it's MPL unless told otherwise" license that is quite common among small XUL applications.  The Preferences Toolbar 2 is now officially MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-licensed, including that huge bandwidth wasting license block at the first of every file.  Feel free to rejoice now.
